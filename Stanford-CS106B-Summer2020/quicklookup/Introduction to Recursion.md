# CS106B: Introduction to Recursion

## Defining recursion

- Recursion: A problem-solving technique in which tasks are completed by reducing them into repeated, smaller tasks of the same form.

- Recursion has two main parts: the base case and the recursive case. 
  - Base case: Simplest form of the problem that has a direct answer. 
  - Recursive case: The step where you break the problem into a smaller, self-similar task.

## Stack frame

- Stack frame:  One gets created each time a function is called. 
  - The “stack” is where in your computer’s memory the information is stored. 
  - A “frame” stores all of the data (variables) for that particular function call.
- Stack frames go away (get cleared from memory) once they return.

## Recursive Fractals

- A fractal is any repeated, graphical pattern.
- A fractal is composed of repeated instances of the same shape or pattern, arranged in a structured way.
