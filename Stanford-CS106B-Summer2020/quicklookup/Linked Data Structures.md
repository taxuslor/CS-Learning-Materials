# CS106B: Linked Lists

## Linked list

- A linked list is a **chain of nodes**.
- Each **node** contains two pieces of information:
  - Some piece of data that is stored in the sequence
  - A link to the next node in the list
- We can traverse the list by starting at the first node and repeatedly following its link.
