- *f* is a *one-to-one function* (or an *injection*) if *f* maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs. More rigorously, *f* is one-to-one if the following holds: *x* ̸= *y* =⇒ *f* (*x*) ̸= *f* (*y*).
- *f* is *onto* (or *surjective*) if it “hits” every element in the range (i.e., each element in the range has at least one pre-image). More precisely, a function *f* is onto if the following holds: (∀*y* ∃*x*)( *f* (*x*) = *y*).

-  *f* is a bijection if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
- We say that a set *S* is countable if there is a bijection between *S* and N or some subset of N. Thus any finite set *S* is countable (since there is a bijection between *S* and the subset {0, 1, 2, . . . , *m* − 1}, where *m* = |*S*| is the size of *S*). 
- Theorem: The real interval R[0, 1] (and hence also the set of real numbers R) is uncountable.
- The Cantor set is a remarkable set construction involving the real numbers in the interval [0,1]. The set is defined by repeatedly removing the middle thirds of line segments infinitely many times, starting with the original interval. The *measure* of the Cantor set is zero; the Cantor set consists of isolated points and does not contain any non-trivial intervals.

- Theorem: |P(N)| > |N|. P(*N*), is the set of all subsets of *N*.

- The cardinality of N is denoted (𐡠0)  (pronounced “aleph null"), while that of P (N) is denoted 2^(𐡠0). Even larger infinite cardinalities (or “orders of infinity”), denoted 𐡠2,𐡠1...,

- Quine: a program that prints itself
- Recursion Theorem:  given any program *P*(*x*,*y*), we can always convert it to another program *Q*(*x*) such that *Q*(*x*) = *P*(*x*, *Q*), i.e., *Q* behaves exactly as *P* would if its second input is the descrip- tion of the program *Q*.

- *Theorem: TestHalt(P,x) =(“yes”, if program P halts on input x “no”, if program P loops on input x.) The Halting Problem is uncomputable; i.e., there does not exist a computer program TestHalt with the behavior specified above on all inputs (P, x).*

- Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem:
  The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.
  The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.
