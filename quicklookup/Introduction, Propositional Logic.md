- *Cardinality:* If *A* = {1,2,3,4}, then the cardinality of *A*, denoted by |*A*|, is 4.
- *Empty Set:* A set cardinality of which is zero, denoted by **∅**.
- *Subset:* If every element of a set *A* is also in set *B*, then we say that *A* is a subset of *B*, written *A* ⊆ *B* (or *B* ⊇ *A*). A proper subset is a set *A* that is strictly contained in *B*, written as *A* ⊂ *B*, meaning that *A* excludes at least one element of *B*.
- *Intersection:* The intersection of a set *A* with a set *B*, written as *A* ∩ *B*, is the set containing all elements which are in both *A* and *B*. Two sets are said to be disjoint if *A* ∩ *B* =**∅**.
- *Union:* The union of a set *A* with a set *B*, written as *A* ∪ *B*, is the set of all elements which are in either *A* or *B* or both.
- *Complements:* If *A* and *B* are two sets, then the relative complement of *A* in *B*, or the set difference between *B* and *A*, written as *B* − *A* or *B* \ *A*, is the set of elements in *B*, but not in *A*: *B* \ *A*={*x*∈*B*|*x*  **∉**  *A*}.
- *Cartesian product(Cross product):* written as *A* × *B*, is the set of all pairs whose first component is an element of *A* and whose second component is an element of *B*. In set notation, *A*×*B* = {(*a*,*b*) | *a* ∈ *A*,*b* ∈ *B*}.
- *Power set:* Given a set *S*, the power set of *S*, denoted by P(*S*), is the set of all subsets of *S*: {*T* |*T* ⊆*S*}.
- N denotes the set of all natural numbers: {0,1,2,3,...}.
  Z denotes the set of all integer numbers: {...,−2,−1,0,1,2,...}.
  Q denotes the set of all rational numbers: {*b* / *a* | *a*,*b* ∈ Z, *b* ̸= 0}. 
  R denotes the set of all real numbers.
  C denotes the set of all complex numbers.
- *Proposition:* A statement is either true or false.
- *Conjunction:*  *P* ∧ *Q* (“*P* and *Q*”). True only when both *P* and *Q* are true.
- *Disjunction:* *P* ∨ *Q* (“*P* or *Q*”). True when at least one of *P* and *Q* is true.
- *Negation:* ¬*P* (“not *P*”). True when *P* is false.
- *the law of the excluded middle:* for any proposition *P*, either *P* is true or ¬*P* is true (but not both), which means *P* ∨ ¬*P* is always true.
- *Tatutology and Contradiction:* A propositional form that is always true regardless of the truth values of its variables is called a *tautology*. Conversely, a statement such as *P* ∧ ¬*P*, which is always false, is called a *contradiction*.
- *Implication:* *P* ⇒ *Q* (“*P* implies *Q*”). This is the same as “If *P*, then *Q*.”  *P* is called the *hypothesis*(*antecedent*) of the implication, and *Q* is the *conclusion*(*consequent*). An implication *P* ⇒ *Q* is false only when *P* is true and *Q* is false. *P* ⇒ *Q* is logically equivalent to ¬*P* ∨ *Q*. If both *P* ⇒ *Q* and *Q* ⇒ *P* are true, then we say “*P* if and only if *Q*” (abbreviated “*P* iff *Q*”). Formally, we write *P* ⇔ *Q*.
- *Different expressions of P ⇒ Q:*
  (1) if *P*, then *Q*;
  (2) *Q* if *P*;
  (3) *P* only if *Q*;
  (4) *P* is sufficient for *Q*; 
  (5) *Q* is necessary for *P*; 
  (6) *Q* unless not *P*.
- Given an implication *P* ⇒ *Q*, we can also define its 
  (a) *Contrapositive:* ¬*Q* ⇒ ¬*P*
  (b) *Converse:* *Q* ⇒ *P*
- *quantifiers:* The *universal quantifier* ∀ (“for all”) and the *existential quantifier* ∃ (“there exists”). We refer to a statement which refers to a variable as a *predicate* or as a *propositional formula* when replacing the variable with a value makes the statement either true or false.
- *De Morgan’s Laws:*
  ¬(*P*∧*Q*) ≡ (¬*P*∨¬*Q*) 
  ¬(*P*∨*Q*) ≡ (¬*P*∧¬*Q*)
