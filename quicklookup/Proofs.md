- *Direct Proof:*

  ​	*Goal*: To prove *P* ⇒ *Q*. 
  ​	*Approach*: Assume *P*
  ​				...

  ​			Therefore *Q*

- *Theorem 2.1. For any a,b,c ∈ Z, if a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c).*

- *Theorem 2.2. Let 0<n<1000 be an integer. If the sum of the digits of n is divisible by 9, then n is divisible by 9.*

- *Theorem 2.3. (Converse of Theorem 2.2). Let 0<n<1000 be an integer. If n is divisible by 9, then the sum of digits of n is divisible by 9.*

- *Proof by Contraposition:*

  ​	*Goal*: To prove *P* ⇒ *Q*. 
  ​	*Approach*: Assume ¬*Q*

  ​				...

  ​		Therefore ¬*P
   	Conclusion*: ¬*Q* ⇒ ¬*P*, which is equivalent to *P* ⇒ *Q*.

- *Theorem 2.4. Let n be a positive integer and let d divide n. If n is odd then d is odd.*

- *Theorem 2.5(Pigenhole Principle). Let n and k be positive integers. Place n objects into k boxes. If n>k, then at least one box must contain multiple objects.*

- *Proof by Contradiction:*

  ​	*Goal*: To prove *P*. 
  ​	*Approach*: Assume ¬*P*

  ​				...

  ​				*R*

  ​				...

  ​				¬*R*
  ​	Conclusion: ¬*P* ⇒ ¬*R* ∧ *R*, which is a contradiction. Thus, *P*.

- *Theorem 2.6. There are infinitely many prime numbers.*

- *Lemma 2.1. Every natural number greater than one is either prime or has a prime divisor.*

- *Theorem 2.7. √2 is irrational.*

- *Lemma 2.2. If a^2 is even, then a is even.*

- *Proof by Cases:* Sometimes when we wish to prove a claim, we don’t know which of a set of possible cases is true, but we know that at least one of the cases is true. What we can do then is to prove the result in both cases; then, clearly the general statement must hold.

- *Theorem 2.8. There exist irrational numbers x and y such that x^y is rational.*
